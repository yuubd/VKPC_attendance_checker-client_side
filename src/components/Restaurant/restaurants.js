			'So after waiting an hr, I was not about to order a benedict that I could get at any brunch place; I wanted something different. My friend recommended the Charlie Bowl to share. They only offer one size (they used to offer small/large options) and this was enough to feed 3+ ppl! It was delicious though and I would get it again. I had food coma after with the biscuit, gravy, hash, ham, bacon, corn, egg, etc all mixed together in one heavy bowl. Leftovers were had. We also had a side of pork belly which came in 2 large pieces which though tasty, was reminiscent of roast pork I would get at the Chinese BBQ joints...'
